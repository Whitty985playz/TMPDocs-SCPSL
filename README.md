# What is text Mesh Pro?
Text Mesh Pro(or TMP) is the Unity UI Text type SCP: Secret Laboratory uses to display information like:

- Server Names
- Server Information
- Broadcasts
- Hints
- TextToys
- etc

There are **some** elements that do not use TMP, however I will not talk about them since this documentation is for your Server Info.

TMP Uses multiple Value Types.

| Attribute/value type: |	Example
| ----- | ----- |
| Decimals | 0.5
| Percentages | 25%
| Pixel values | 5px
| Font units | 1.5em
| Hex color values | #FFFFFF (RGB)
| | #FFFFFFFF (RGBA)
| | #FF (A)
| Names	| Both <link=”ID”> and <link=ID> are valid.

In SCP: Secret Laboratory, you will not be able to use tags like `<sprite>` Instead, it is recommended that you use [**Emojis**](https://boltondev.github.io/SL-Emojis).

# üìï | What you need to know
Gernerally, your server name is what people see when scrolling through the server list.

Your server's name on the server list shows the amount of people that are online and your server's tags.

There are only 4 server tags, these being:

- Modded
- Official
- Friendly Fire
- Whitelist

When it comes to emojis in server names, they normally can not be used.

## ‚úèÔ∏è | Creating Your Custom Server Name

Default Server Name Config:
```yml
server_name: Server Name
#default - uses server_name
player_list_title: Default
```

This can be found in: **`home\container\\.config\SCP Secret Laboratory/config/\(Server Port\)/config_gameplay.txt`**

Here are the tags you can use in your server name:

| TMP Syntax | Usage | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| \<b> \</b> | Creating **Bold** Text. | Hello \<b>World!\</b> |
| \<i> \</i> | *Italics* | \<i>Hello\</i> World! | 
| \<u> \</u> | <ins>Underline</ins> Text | \<u>Hello\</u> World! | 
| \<s> \</s> | ~~Strike Through~~ Text | \<s>Hello\</s> World! | 
| \<color=\[HEX\]> \</color> | Coloring Text | \<color=red>Hello\</color> World! | 
| \<alpha=#XX> \</alpha> | Changing the Alpha Channel of Text | \<alpha=#55>Hello\</i> World! | 
| \<size=###> \</size> | Resizing Text | \<size=40>Hello\</size> World! | 

Northwood blocks \***most**\* of the syntax tags when it comes to server names, generally, the Roboto is used(This is the font that is used in basically the whole game).

In terms of limitations, you CAN

- Have gradients in your server name,
- Have *some* special characters in your server name.

However, you CANNOT

- Have Emojis in your server name,
- Break the CSG with your server name.
